**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6)

## Skills Invoked

| # | Skill | Status | What It Provided | Applied To |
|---|-------|--------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | `skill-orchestrator` | LOADED | Workflow orchestration patterns, multi-skill sequencing | Overall audit coordination — determined skill order and agent dispatch strategy |
| 2 | `dispatching-parallel-agents` | LOADED + APPLIED | Parallel agent dispatch pattern for independent problem domains | Core pattern: 6 agents (A1-A6) dispatched in 3 waves (4 parallel → A3 sequential → A6 sequential) |
| 3 | `code-auditor` | LOADED + APPLIED | Code audit methodology: architecture, quality, security, testing, maintainability | A1 (claim extraction), A2 (evidence verification), A4 (schema/policy deep verify), A6 (meta-consistency) |
| 4 | `test-master` | LOADED + APPLIED | Testing specialist: pytest execution, coverage analysis, test quality assessment | A2: pytest --collect-only (5 tests), pytest -v (5/5 PASS), ruff lint (0 errors) |
| 5 | `systematic-debugging` | LOADED + APPLIED | 4-phase debugging: root cause investigation, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing | A3: Root cause analysis of 16 contradictions → 3 root causes identified (post-fix propagation, AGE priority shift, stale test count) |
| 6 | `rag-architect` | LOADED + APPLIED | RAG systems expertise: retrieval evaluation, metadata enrichment validation | A5: Semantic inflation analysis — distinguished HTTP-verified vs research-documented vs schema-validated claims |
| 7 | `context-engineering` | LOADED + APPLIED | Context management for multi-agent workflows | Lead coordination: passing ground truth values between agents, managing dependencies |
| 8 | `coverage-analysis` | LOADED + APPLIED | Code/test coverage assessment methodology | A2: URL coverage analysis (264 COVERED / 15 NOT_COVERED), allowlist domain matching |

## Skill Usage Details

### dispatching-parallel-agents
- **Wave 1 (parallel):** A1 Claim Extractor + A2 Evidence Verifier + A4 Policy/Schema Verifier + A5 Semantic Red Team
- **Wave 2 (sequential, depends on Wave 1):** A3 Drift & Consistency Reconciler
- **Wave 3 (sequential, depends on Wave 2):** A6 Meta-Consistency Checker
- **Pattern:** Each agent receives focused scope, clear deliverables, and specific output paths
- **Team:** Formal team created via TeamCreate (audit-v5) with task dependencies

### code-auditor
- Applied 6-dimension audit framework: architecture, quality, security, performance, testing, maintainability
- Specialized for forensic anti-hallucination context: claim extraction, evidence-backed verification, drift detection
- Output: 280 claims extracted, 55 ground truth metrics computed, 11 meta-consistency checks

### test-master
- Executed pytest with collect-only and verbose modes
- Verified test count (5), pass rate (5/5), negative test existence (2)
- Ran ruff linter on scripts/ and tests/
- Constraint verified: "MUST DO: Test happy paths AND error cases" — 3 positive + 2 negative tests

### systematic-debugging
- Phase 1 (Root Cause): Traced 16 contradictions to 3 root causes
- Phase 2 (Pattern): Identified "post-fix propagation failure" as dominant pattern (10/16 contradictions)
- Phase 3 (Hypothesis): Confirmed fixes were applied to data but not propagated to docs
- Applied to: Explaining AGE P1/P2 mismatch, tier_3 count drift, test count staleness

### rag-architect
- Constraint: "MUST NOT: Skip metadata enrichment" — verified claims distinguish between research-documented vs HTTP-verified vs schema-validated
- Applied to: 36 semantic inflation findings, detecting "verified" used 15+ times without HTTP evidence
- Key insight: 3/3 URL smoke test = 4.7% actual coverage (3/64 portal URLs)

### context-engineering
- Managed ground truth propagation between agents (A2 → A3)
- Structured prompts with complete context for each agent
- Maintained consistency across 3 execution waves

### coverage-analysis
- URL extraction: 541 occurrences, 284 unique URLs, 134 domains
- Allowlist coverage: 264 COVERED, 15 NOT_COVERED
- Phantom path analysis: 33 EXISTS, 0 PHANTOM, 1 PLANNED_FUTURE, 2 GLOB_PATTERN
