## 1. OdiseIA: The Organization Behind the Hackathon

### What is OdiseIA?

OdiseIA (Observatory of the Social and Ethical Impact of Artificial Intelligence) is a globally-recognized, independent, non-profit, action-oriented think tank founded in November 2019. It is not a typical tech accelerator -- it is an ethics-first organization deeply rooted in Spanish institutional networks including academia, the Catholic Church (via the Pablo VI Foundation), major tech corporations, and the Spanish government.

**Mission:** To move beyond theoretical discourse and create practical solutions to the most pressing challenges in AI, specifically promoting the ethical, legitimate, responsible, and socially beneficial use of AI.

**Key institutional fact:** OdiseIA is registered at the same address as the Pablo VI Foundation, a Catholic institution founded in 1968 by Cardinal Angel Herrera Oria. The Foundation's values center on Christian social conscience, social justice, human promotion, and dialogue with science and technology. This matters because it shapes what "impact" means to the organizers -- it is about human dignity, not just metrics.

**Royal Endorsement:** His Majesty King Felipe VI serves as Honorary President of the OdiseIA4Good Hackathon. This is not a minor detail -- it signals that the hackathon has the highest level of institutional legitimacy in Spain.

## 2. UDIT University Context

**Full name:** Universidad de Diseno, Innovacion y Tecnologia (University of Design, Innovation and Technology)

**Profile:** UDIT is Spain's first and only university specialized in Design, Innovation and Technology. It evolved from over 20 years of ESNE (a prestigious design school). Campus of 21,000+ square meters, 3,000+ students, located in Madrid.

**Academic Programs:** Official Masters in User Experience, Graphic Design, Interior Design, Illustration, Product Design, Artificial Intelligence, Fashion Design, and Educational Technology.

**Hackathon Track Record:**
- Four UDIT student teams qualified for OdiseIA4Good 2026 final
- Two UDIT teams won challenges at IndesIAHack 2025 (organized by IndesIA and Polytechnic University of Madrid)
- Active partnership with Secpho for deep tech innovation

**What UDIT-affiliated judges value:**
- **Design quality** -- This is a design university. UX, visual polish, and user-centered thinking matter enormously.
- **Innovation** -- "Innovation" is literally in their name.
- **Technology** -- Practical, working technology, not just concepts.
- **Interdisciplinary approaches** -- Their programs span design, AI, and user experience.

**Strategic implication:** If UDIT provides any judges or mentors, they will be particularly sensitive to how well-designed and user-friendly the interface is. Clara's WhatsApp-first approach, multilingual support, and accessibility features align well with UDIT's UX and inclusive design philosophy.

## 3. Official Evaluation Criteria (CRITICAL)

The OdiseIA4Good hackathon uses a multi-stage evaluation system. Based on research, the scoring breakdown is:

### Stage 1: Pre-Selection (Online Phase)
- **Innovation (30%):** Degree of novelty, originality in AI use, differentiation from existing solutions
- **Social Impact (30%):** Potential to improve quality of life of the target vulnerable group
- Additional criteria: Relevance for digital inclusion of vulnerable groups

### Stage 2: In-Person Grand Finale (Feb 23-25)

**Prototype Demonstration in front of Jury (25%):**
- Actual operation of the prototype: 35%
- Level of development achieved: 30%
- Effective integration of AI: 25%
- Technical and creative originality: 10%

**Evaluation by Social Entities (25%):**
- Social relevance for the vulnerable group: 35%
- Applicability and feasibility of implementation: 30%
- Inclusion and accessibility: 25%
- Expected direct impact: 10%

**Elevator Pitch to the Jury (40%):**
- Brief and persuasive presentation
- Must highlight: innovation, social impact, technical feasibility, scalability potential

**Open Voting via LinkedIn (10%):**
- Three weeks before the final, the public can vote
- Teams can encourage friends and family to vote

### What This Tells Us

1. **The elevator pitch is the single most important component (40%).** Presentation quality is not a nice-to-have -- it is nearly half the final score.
2. **Working prototype matters enormously (25%).** The jury physically visits each team's workspace. They want to see something REAL that works.
3. **Social entity evaluation (25%)** means NGO people and third-sector experts will judge applicability and accessibility. They care about whether this could actually be deployed.
4. **Innovation is weighted at 30%** in the pre-selection phase, suggesting creative AI use is a gating factor.
5. **The LinkedIn vote (10%)** rewards teams with network reach and social media savvy.

## 4. 2025 Winners and What Made Them Win

### GaIA -- Wolaria Award Winner (Accelerator Prize)

**Team:** Miguel Esteban Salazar, Alex Montecino Puerto, Pablo Martinez Rodrigo

**Project:** GaIA -- an anti-loneliness AI assistant for seniors. Two-pronged approach: (1) an app for families/caregivers to better support seniors, and (2) hardware for simple, accessible interaction.

**Why they won:**
- Addressed a deeply emotional, universally understood problem (elderly loneliness)
- Combined software AND hardware vision -- showed ambition beyond a single app
- Built a sustainable business model alongside the technology
- Post-hackathon, they entered Wolaria's accelerator and received business support from the Institute for Business Competitiveness of Castilla y Leon

### Other Notable 2025 Projects

- **Emancipatic Challenge:** Focused on "Closing digital gaps: inclusive tools for the autonomy of elderly people and vulnerable groups" -- promoting accessible tool design with intuitive interfaces, personalized AI-driven digital skills training, and cybersecurity protection.
- **42 teams** across areas including: employment for people with disabilities, migration, digital divide, climate, and education.

### Patterns from 2025 Winners

1. **Emotional resonance** -- "Loneliness in seniors" is something every judge can relate to personally
2. **Clear vulnerable group** -- Not trying to help "everyone," but a specific population
3. **Dual innovation** -- Both technical (AI) and practical (hardware/UX)
4. **Post-hackathon viability** -- The team demonstrated they could become a real venture
5. **Simplicity in the pitch** -- One sentence explains GaIA: "AI assistant that fights loneliness in seniors"

---

## 5. The 2026 Vulnerable Group Categories

Projects must target one or more of these five official categories:

1. **Seniors (Personas Mayores):** Loneliness, dependency, barriers to accessing basic services
2. **Children, Adolescents, and Young People:** Violence, poverty, social exclusion
3. **Migrants and Refugees:** Integration challenges, rights, belonging
4. **People with Disabilities:** Accessibility, support, equity for full social participation
5. **Disaster-Affected Communities:** Loss of homes, livelihoods, security

**Clara's positioning:** Clara primarily serves **Migrants and Refugees** (Category 3) but also overlaps with **Seniors** (Category 1 -- elderly immigrants navigating bureaucracy) and **People with Disabilities** (Category 4 -- voice-first accessibility). This multi-category coverage is a strength.

## 6. What Social Impact Hackathon Judges Typically Value

### Universal Hackathon Judging Criteria

Based on research across multiple social impact hackathon frameworks:

| Criterion | Weight | What Judges Look For |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Innovation** | High | Fresh perspective on a real problem; novel use of technology; differentiated from existing solutions |
| **Social Impact** | Highest | Measurable potential to improve lives; alignment with real needs (not imagined ones); scale of affected population |
| **Feasibility** | Medium-High | Can this actually be built and deployed? Resource requirements? Timeline? |
| **Scalability** | Medium | Can it grow beyond the hackathon? Is the architecture extensible? |
| **Sustainability** | Medium | Long-term viability without continuous funding; business model thinking |
| **Presentation/Demo** | Very High | Live demo > slides; emotional connection; clear problem-solution narrative |
| **Team** | Medium | Multidisciplinary composition; evidence of collaboration |
| **Accessibility/Inclusion** | High (for OdiseIA) | Can the most vulnerable actually use this? No digital literacy barriers? |

### What Makes a Project MEMORABLE vs Forgettable

**Memorable projects:**
- Have a clear, one-sentence description anyone can understand
- Show a LIVE demo that works in front of judges (not mockups)
- Create an emotional moment -- judges should FEEL something
- Demonstrate real user validation or testing with the target population
- Show something unexpected ("wow moment")

**Forgettable projects:**
- Overload with features instead of focusing on one killer feature
- Only show slides/mockups with no working prototype
- Use generic AI buzzwords without demonstrating actual AI integration
- Try to solve too many problems at once
- Have a complicated explanation that requires multiple slides to understand

### The "Wow Moment" in Demos

Research across hackathon best practices consistently identifies these elements:

1. **Live interaction:** Let a judge or audience member USE the product in real-time. For Clara: have a judge send a WhatsApp message and see the response live.
2. **The magic moment:** When users are genuinely amazed by the experience. For Clara: sending a voice message in French and getting a Spanish bureaucracy answer back in seconds.
3. **Emotional storytelling:** Start with a real person's story. "Maria arrived from Morocco last week. She doesn't speak Spanish. She needs healthcare for her child. Here is what happens when she sends Clara a voice message..."
4. **Focused demo:** One to two features demonstrated perfectly beats five features demonstrated poorly.
5. **Audience participation:** "Everyone, take out your phones. Send a WhatsApp message to this number..." -- This is extremely powerful but risky. Only do it if the system is bulletproof.

**What they value:** Scientific rigor, ethical framework, novel methodological approach, responsible AI practices
**How to appeal:** Highlight anti-hallucination guardrails, ethical content policies, evaluation metrics (your 532 tests, P@3=86%), responsible AI design decisions

### C. NGO/Social Sector Leaders
**Examples:** ONCE Foundation, Emancipatic, third-sector organizations
**What they value:** Real-world applicability, accessibility, user-centered design, feasibility for underserved populations, inclusion
**How to appeal:** Demonstrate WhatsApp-first design (no app download needed), voice support (no literacy required), multilingual capability, zero-cost for users

### D. Government/Policy Officials
**Examples:** Miguel Escassi (Google/former gov advisor), Pablo VI Foundation leadership
**What they value:** Regulatory alignment, public service integration potential, data privacy, institutional sustainability
**How to appeal:** Reference EU AI Act compliance readiness, GDPR considerations, potential integration with Spanish government service portals, knowledge base extensibility

## 8. Strategic Recommendations for Clara

### Positioning Statement
"Clara is a WhatsApp voice assistant that helps vulnerable immigrants in Spain navigate government services -- in their own language, through their own voice, on the phone they already have."

### Top 5 Recommendations

**1. Lead with Emotion, Not Technology (Elevator Pitch = 40%)**
The pitch is worth 40% of the final score. Structure it as:
- Open with a specific human story (30 seconds)
- State the problem in one sentence (10 seconds)
- Live demo -- send a real WhatsApp voice message and show the response (90 seconds)
- Explain the technical innovation briefly (30 seconds)
- Close with scale/impact potential (30 seconds)

**2. Make the Live Demo Bulletproof (Prototype = 25%)**
The jury will visit your workspace. Prepare for:
- A phone with WhatsApp open, ready to send messages to Clara
- Pre-tested scenarios that work 100% of the time
- Voice messages in Spanish, French, and possibly Arabic
- An image analysis demo (send a photo of a government document)
- Have a backup video of the demo in case of network issues

**3. Emphasize the "No Download, No Literacy" Innovation**
This is Clara's most powerful differentiator. Every other team will likely build an app or a web tool. Clara meets users where they already are (WhatsApp) and works through voice (no reading required). This is radical accessibility. Frame it as: "Clara has ZERO barrier to adoption. No download. No signup. No reading. Just talk."

**4. Quantify Social Impact for the Social Entity Evaluators (25%)**
Prepare concrete numbers:
- How many immigrants arrive in Spain annually?
- How many face language barriers in government services?
- What is the cost of failed bureaucratic processes (missed appointments, incorrect forms)?
- How much time does Clara save per query vs. the current process?

**5. Activate the LinkedIn Vote (10%)**
Start immediately:
- Create a compelling 30-second video of Clara in action
- Post on LinkedIn with #OdiseIA4Good hashtag
- Tag OdiseIA, UDIT, Google.org, and relevant organizations
- Ask every team member's network to vote
- Create a QR code at the demo table linking to the voting page

### Alignment with OdiseIA Values

| OdiseIA Value | Clara Feature |
|---------------|---------------|
| Ethical AI | Guardrails, anti-hallucination, content safety layer |
| Vulnerable groups | Immigrants, refugees, elderly immigrants |
| Digital inclusion | WhatsApp-first, voice-first, no app needed |
| Responsible AI | 532 tests, evaluation framework, confidence scoring |
| Accessibility | Multilingual (ES/FR), voice input/output, image analysis |
| Feasibility | Working prototype deployed on Render, not a mockup |
| Scalability | Extensible KB (any .json), RAG pipeline, Docker-ready |

### What to AVOID

1. **Do not lead with technical architecture.** Judges care about impact first, technology second.
2. **Do not try to demo every feature.** Pick voice-in-Spanish, voice-in-French, and image analysis. Three demos max.
3. **Do not use English in the pitch** unless specifically required. The judges are Spanish-speaking; the hackathon has international elements but is Madrid-based.
4. **Do not neglect the design.** UDIT is a design university. If you have any UI component (web dashboard, etc.), make it visually polished.
5. **Do not forget the business model question.** Judges will ask "how does this sustain itself?" Have an answer: government partnerships, NGO licensing, freemium model.
