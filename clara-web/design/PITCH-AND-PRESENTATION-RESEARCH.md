## 1. Winning Hackathon Pitch Deck Design

### Optimal Slide Count and Structure

Hackathon pitch decks differ significantly from investor decks. While Y Combinator's standard template has 10-12 slides for seed rounds, hackathon decks should aim for **6-8 slides maximum** for a 5-6 minute presentation. The rule of thumb: approximately one slide per minute, with the demo consuming 1-2 minutes of that time.

**Recommended Slide Order for Clara (6-minute format):**

| Slide | Time | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1. Hook / Problem | 45s | Shocking statistic about vulnerable populations in Spain |
| 2. Who Suffers | 30s | The human face -- one persona, one story |
| 3. Solution: Clara | 45s | What Clara does, in one sentence + visual |
| 4. Live Demo | 90s | WhatsApp interaction showing voice + text + image |
| 5. Architecture / How | 30s | Simple system diagram (not cluttered) |
| 6. Impact + Next Steps | 30s | Metrics, scalability, and call to action |
| 7. Team | 15s | Faces, roles, one-liner each |

This structure front-loads the emotional impact (problem + person), then transitions to rational proof (demo + architecture), and closes with forward-looking energy.

### The Y Combinator / Sequoia Influence

The YC format works because it is "brutally efficient": problem, solution, timing, market, product, business, competition, team, traction, funding. For a hackathon adaptation, strip this down further:

- **Keep:** Problem, Solution, Product (demo), Team
- **Adapt:** Market becomes "Impact Scale" (4.5M vulnerable people)
- **Remove:** Financials, Competition, Funding Ask (not relevant for hackathon)

### The "Less is More" Rule -- Apple Keynote Style

A former Apple employee documented how Apple makes slides internally. The core philosophy:

> "The slides are here to help people 'visualise' what you are articulating. The overarching theme is, how do we simplify and reduce the amount of content to display."

**Key principles from Apple's approach:**

1. **One idea per slide.** If you are packing too many things into a slide, ask yourself: is everything here really important? Get rid of the secondary stuff and talk about them instead. Split sequential ideas into multiple slides.

2. **Big numbers get their own slide.** When Tim Cook presented "6 million registered developers" and a "71 seconds -- Sold out" statistic, each got its own full slide. If a statistic is important enough and you want people to remember it, give it its own slide.

3. **Slides support the speaker, not replace them.** The audience should be looking at you and glancing at the slide for visual reinforcement, not reading paragraphs.

**For Clara:** The "4.5 million vulnerable people" statistic deserves its own full-screen slide with nothing else -- just the number and one sentence of context.

### Color and Typography That Win

**Font choices:**
- Use sans-serif fonts exclusively (Helvetica, Inter, Montserrat, or similar). Sans-serif fonts communicate innovation, technology, and modernity.
- Title text: minimum 24pt (ideally 36pt+)
- Body text: minimum 18pt
- Never go below 14pt for anything, even footnotes

**Color guidelines:**
- Maintain WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Limit your palette to 2-3 colors maximum: one primary brand color, one accent, and neutrals (black/white/gray)
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information (accessibility for colorblind audience members)

**For Clara specifically:** Given the social impact context, warm but professional colors work best. Consider a primary purple or teal (trust, compassion) with a warm accent (orange/coral for energy and accessibility). Avoid cold corporate blues that might distance the human element.

### Before/After Redesign Lessons

Common problems in amateur pitch decks and their fixes:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Information overload -- too many bullet points | One headline + one supporting visual per slide |
| Small fonts with cluttered layouts | Double font sizes, ruthlessly cut text |
| Generic stock photos | Custom illustrations, real screenshots, team photos |
| Charts without clear labels | Big number + one-sentence context instead |
| Inconsistent styling | Use a single template, lock fonts and colors |

The transformation from amateur to professional "is not about cosmetics but transformation -- it turns information into communication, slides into story, and attention into belief."

## 2. Data Visualization for Social Impact

### Humanizing the "4.5 Million" Number

Research on the "psychic numbing effect" (also called "compassion fade") shows that our capacity for empathy **decreases** as the number of people suffering rises. When talking about millions who are suffering, audiences care less and less because the number becomes abstract.

**Strategies to counter this:**

1. **The One Person Technique**: Start with a single person's story before revealing the scale. "Maria is 72 years old. She lives alone in Vallecas. She doesn't know she qualifies for three government benefits that would change her life. There are 4.5 million Marias in Spain." This moves from concrete to abstract, anchoring empathy before scaling it.

2. **Make the number relatable**: Instead of "4.5 million vulnerable people," try: "That's one in every ten Spaniards" or "That's the entire population of the Balearic Islands, Cantabria, and Navarra combined."

3. **Dot visualization**: The New York Times created a graphic where each individual dot represented a life lost to COVID. This approach -- showing individual units within a large number -- reminds the audience of the people behind the statistic "in a way that isn't so easy with aggregated numbers like averages."

4. **Face + Fact pairing**: A spreadsheet is "just numbers until a human face is put to them." Always pair any large statistic with a specific, named individual whose story illustrates it.

**Recommendation for Clara:** Open with Maria's story (15 seconds), then reveal the scale (one slide with just "4,500,000" in large type), then immediately say "Clara already helped 8 of them in our demo" to show agency and progress.

### Accessible Chart and Graph Design

- Use colorblind-safe palettes (avoid red/green combinations; use blue/orange instead)
- Add pattern fills or texture, not just color, to distinguish data series
- Provide detailed alt-text descriptions on any shared materials
- Use large, clear labels directly on charts rather than legends that require cross-referencing
- Minimum font size of 14pt on any chart text

### Best Tools for Creating Accessible Infographics

| Tool | Best For | Cost | Accessibility |
|------|----------|------|---------------|
| **Canva** | Quick infographics, social media, posters | Free (Pro free for nonprofits) | Good built-in accessibility features |
| **Figma** | Detailed UI mockups, phone frames | Free tier available | Manual accessibility requires plugins |
| **Visme** | Data visualization, presentations | Free tier available | Strong data viz focus |
| **Piktochart** | Infographics, posters | Free tier available | Good template library |

Canva is the recommended primary tool for Clara's materials. It offers free Pro access for nonprofit projects, an extensive template library for social impact/charity infographics, and built-in accessibility features.

## 3. Physical Materials Design for Tech Events

### Poster Design Best Practices

**Sizes and use cases:**
- **A4 (210x297mm)**: Handouts, leave-behinds at judge tables
- **A3 (297x420mm)**: Table displays, booth posters at comfortable reading distance
- **Roll-up banner (85x200cm)**: High visibility from across a room, ideal if booth space is available

**Design principles for hackathon posters:**
- Visual hierarchy: Logo/name at top (30% of space), key metric/hook in middle, QR code + contact at bottom
- Maximum 50 words of text on any poster
- Images and diagrams should occupy at least 60% of the space
- Include a clear call to action ("Scan to try Clara" or "Ask us for a demo")

### Business Card / Mini-Flyer Design

For a hackathon, a mini-flyer (half A5 or credit-card sized) is more practical than traditional business cards:

- **Front**: Clara logo, one-sentence description, WhatsApp QR code to try the demo
- **Back**: Team member names, GitHub repo URL, contact email
- Print 50-100 copies (judges, mentors, other teams, sponsors)

### QR Code Design -- Best Practices

**Sizing rules (the 10:1 ratio):**
- The scanning distance should be approximately 10x the width of the QR code
- For flyers: minimum 2.5cm x 2.5cm (1 inch)
- For posters: minimum 5cm x 5cm (2 inches) -- larger if people scan from a distance
- For roll-ups: minimum 10cm x 10cm

**Branding your QR codes:**
- Add a logo in the center, but it must not cover more than 30% of the total QR code area
- Never obscure the three large corner squares ("finder patterns") -- these are essential for scanning
- Use dark patterns on light backgrounds (dark QR on white)
- Leave at least 4 modules of white space ("quiet zone") around the QR code boundary
- Always add a text label: "Scan to try Clara" (accessibility for those unfamiliar with QR codes)

**Accessibility requirements:**
- Always provide an alternative URL link alongside the QR code
- Place QR codes at 120-150cm from the ground on standing displays (comfortable for wheelchair users)
- Use high contrast (black on white is most reliable)

### Print-Ready Specifications

| Spec | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Color mode | CMYK (not RGB -- RGB will print with inaccurate colors) |
| Resolution | 300 DPI minimum at 100% print size |
| Bleed | 3mm (0.125") on all sides for posters and flyers |
| Safe zone | Keep all critical text/logos at least 3mm inside the trim line |
| File format | PDF/X-1a is the industry standard for print |
| Business card bleed | 2.5mm (0.1") on all sides, making a 2" x 3.5" card into 2.1" x 3.6" |

### Cost-Effective Printing in Madrid

Several options near the UDIT campus area:

| Service | Specialty | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Workcenter** | Full-service copy shop, stores in Madrid/Barcelona | Express poster printing, business cards, lamination |
| **Telex 24** | Digital printing, 30+ years in Madrid | Posters, business cards, flyers, roll-ups, good price-quality |
| **Iconestudio** | Fast printing, Madrid center | Phone: 915224695, claims cheapest in Madrid center |
| **Copyboom** | Online ordering, Madrid delivery | Color copies from 0.06 EUR, same-day delivery in Madrid |
| **Pro Copisteria** | Online 24/7, free shipping | Low-cost, best for bulk orders |
| **Pixartprinting** | Online, 24h digital printing | Good for pre-ordering materials before the event |

**Recommendation:** Order materials from Pixartprinting or Copyboom 2-3 days before the event. Have a backup plan with Workcenter or Telex 24 for last-minute prints on-site.

## 4. Presentation Delivery Techniques

### The 6-Minute Demo Format

Based on analysis of winning hackathon presentations, the optimal 6-minute structure is:

```
[0:00 - 0:45]  HOOK: Open with a shocking statistic or personal story
[0:45 - 1:15]  PROBLEM: Why this matters, who suffers, why now
[1:15 - 2:00]  SOLUTION: What Clara does, one sentence, then show it
[2:00 - 3:30]  DEMO: Live interaction with Clara (voice + text + image)
[3:30 - 4:15]  HOW: Architecture diagram, tech stack highlights
[4:15 - 5:15]  IMPACT: Metrics, scalability, real-world application
[5:15 - 5:45]  TEAM: Who we are, why we care
[5:45 - 6:00]  CLOSE: Call to action, memorable closing line
```

### Opening Hooks That Work for Social Impact

Research on 200+ TED talks found that the most effective openings combine emotional storytelling with concrete data. Three proven patterns:

1. **The Shocking Statistic**: Jamie Oliver opened his TED Talk with "In the next 18 minutes, four Americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat." For Clara: "In the time it takes me to give this presentation, 12 vulnerable people in Spain will give up trying to apply for government aid they are entitled to."

2. **The Personal Story**: Start with a single named individual. "Maria is 72. She lives alone in Vallecas. Last month she missed the deadline for her heating subsidy because the government website crashed on her phone and the call center put her on hold for 3 hours. Maria now owes 340 euros she doesn't have."

3. **The Provocative Question**: "What if the most powerful AI in the world could help the people who need it most -- through an app they already have on their phone?"

**Best for Clara:** Combine patterns 2 and 1. Start with Maria's 15-second story, then hit with the scale statistic. This is the "individual to universal" technique used by the most effective TED speakers.

### Live Demo Backup Strategies

The number one rule of hackathon demos: **always have a backup**. Three levels of fallback:

1. **Primary**: Live demo on a real device (phone showing WhatsApp interaction with Clara)
2. **Backup 1**: Pre-recorded screen recording of the exact same demo flow, embedded in the slide deck, ready to play instantly if the live demo fails
3. **Backup 2**: Screenshots of the conversation arranged in a slide, with the presenter narrating "what would happen" -- this is the last resort but still better than a frozen screen

**Additional precautions:**
- Run the demo locally if possible (no dependency on venue WiFi)
- Have a second device (phone/laptop) pre-loaded with the demo
- Pre-seed the demo with test data so you are not waiting for API responses live
- Practice the exact demo flow 10+ times the night before
- If the demo breaks during the presentation, do not panic or apologize excessively. Switch to the backup smoothly and say "Let me show you what that looks like" while playing the video.

### Body Language and Voice Modulation

**Body language essentials:**
- Maintain open posture (no crossed arms, hands visible)
- Use purposeful gestures to emphasize key points (not fidgeting)
- Maintain eye contact with judges -- scan the panel, spending 3-5 seconds per person
- Stand to the side of the screen, never in front of it
- When showing the demo, turn your body partially toward the screen but keep glancing back at the judges

**Voice modulation for impact:**
- **Slow down** for statistics and key numbers (let them land)
- **Speed up slightly** during the demo (conveys excitement and energy)
- **Pause** after the opening hook (silence creates emphasis)
- **Lower your volume** when sharing the personal story (intimacy draws people in)
- **Raise your volume and pace** for the call to action at the end

### Handling Q&A from Judges

The most common questions judges ask at hackathons:

| Question Type | Example | Preparation Strategy |
|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| Scalability | "How does this scale beyond the hackathon?" | Prepare specific numbers: X users, Y cost, Z infrastructure |
| Technical depth | "How does the RAG pipeline work?" | Have one team member ready for deep technical questions |
| Differentiation | "Why not just use ChatGPT?" | Prepare a clear 30-second answer on WhatsApp-first, voice, vulnerability focus |
| Impact measurement | "How do you measure success?" | Define 3 concrete metrics (users helped, time saved, benefits accessed) |
| Accessibility | "How do non-tech-savvy users interact?" | Demo the voice interface specifically, emphasize no app download needed |

**Key strategies:**
- Anticipate the top 5 questions and rehearse answers (20-40 minutes of prep is enough)
- Designate specific team members for specific question types (technical vs. impact vs. design)
- If you don't know the answer, say "That's a great question we haven't fully explored yet, but our hypothesis is..." -- never bluff
- Keep answers under 30 seconds. Judges appreciate conciseness.

## 5. Slide Design Patterns and Templates

### The "Big Number + One Sentence" Pattern

This is the single most effective slide pattern for social impact presentations. The format:

```
+------------------------------------------+
|                                          |
|                                          |
|            4,500,000                     |
|                                          |
|   vulnerable people in Spain struggle    |
|   to access government aid every year    |
|                                          |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

- The number is 72pt+ font, bold, centered
- The explanatory sentence is 24pt, lighter weight, below
- Nothing else on the slide -- no logos, no images, no decoration
- Let the number speak for itself

Use this pattern for: the problem scale, key technical metrics (response time, accuracy), and impact numbers.

### Before/After Comparison Slides

For showing Clara's value proposition, a split-screen "before/after" is powerful:

```
+------------------------------------------+
|  WITHOUT CLARA     |   WITH CLARA        |
|                    |                      |
|  3-hour phone      |   2-minute WhatsApp  |
|  wait times        |   conversation       |
|                    |                      |
|  Complex web       |   Voice message in   |
|  forms in Spanish  |   Spanish or French  |
|  only              |                      |
|                    |                      |
|  72% abandon rate  |   Photo of document  |
|                    |   = instant guidance  |
+------------------------------------------+
```

### Architecture Diagram Slides

For the technical "How it works" slide, follow these rules:

- **Use arrows to show flow**, group related elements into modules, and show direction
- **Choose one direction and stick with it** (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
- **Maximum 6-7 boxes** in the diagram. If you have more, you are showing too much detail.
- **Do not turn the slide into a technical manual.** The diagram supports a 30-second verbal explanation.
- Use color coding: one color for user-facing components, another for backend, a third for external services
- Label every arrow and every box with plain language, not technical jargon

**For Clara:** A simplified version of the architecture:
```
User (WhatsApp) --> Twilio --> Flask --> [Whisper | Gemini | RAG] --> Response --> User
```
Six boxes, clear flow, one direction. The presenter explains the nuances verbally.

### Demo Screenshot Framing

For showing the WhatsApp interface in slides:

- Use **phone mockup frames** to make screenshots feel real and professional
- Recommended tools: Shotsnapp, MockUPhone (free), Rotato, Device Frames, Pika.style
- Frame the screenshot in an iPhone or Android device, slightly angled for visual interest
- Show 2-3 key conversation moments side by side (text query, voice response, image analysis)
- Figma has free WhatsApp UI screen templates for creating custom conversation mockups

### The Closing Slide -- What Makes Judges Remember You

Research consistently shows that weak closings kill otherwise strong presentations. The closing slide must:

1. **Include a specific call to action.** Not "Thanks for listening" but "Scan this QR code to talk to Clara right now" or "We are looking for NGO partners to pilot Clara in three cities."

2. **Restate the core impact.** One sentence: "Clara makes government aid accessible to 4.5 million vulnerable people through the app they already use every day."

3. **Show confidence.** End with a forward-looking statement: "Clara is ready for real-world deployment. The question is not whether this technology works -- it's how fast we can get it to the people who need it."

4. **Include practical contact info.** QR code to the demo, team email, GitHub link.

The last slide stays on screen during Q&A, so it is the visual that lingers in judges' minds. Make it count.

## 6. Hackathon Judging Criteria and What Wins

### OdiseIA4Good 2026 Specific Criteria

Based on research into the OdiseIA4Good hackathon evaluation framework, teams are evaluated by **two separate juries** with different focuses:

**Technical Jury (Day 3 -- Prototype Demonstration):**

| Criterion | Weight | What They Evaluate |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| Actual operation of the prototype | 35% | Does it work? Is it functional? |
| Level of development achieved | 30% | How complete is it relative to the ambition? |
| Effective integration of AI | 25% | Is AI core to the solution, not bolted on? |
| Technical and creative originality | 10% | Novel approach or just standard implementation? |

**Social Impact Jury (Third Sector Organizations + Social Impact Experts):**

| Criterion | Weight | What They Evaluate |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| Social relevance for the vulnerable group | 35% | Does it solve a real, pressing problem? |
| Applicability and feasibility of implementation | 30% | Could this actually be deployed? |
| Inclusion and accessibility | 25% | Can the target population actually use it? |
| Expected direct impact | 10% | How many people could this help? |

**Elevator Pitch (40% of final score):**
Each team delivers an elevator pitch to the jury highlighting innovation, social impact, technical feasibility, and scalability potential. This is the single largest scoring component.

### What Clara Should Emphasize Per Category

Given the weighting, here is how Clara should tailor messaging:

**For the Technical Jury:**
- Demonstrate a working prototype with live audio + text + image processing (35% -- prototype operation)
- Show the RAG pipeline, fallback chain, and multi-skill architecture (30% -- development level)
- Emphasize Whisper + Gemini + PGVector integration as AI-core, not a wrapper (25% -- AI integration)
- Highlight the WhatsApp-first approach as novel for vulnerable populations (10% -- originality)

**For the Social Impact Jury:**
- Lead with the "4.5 million vulnerable people" statistic and Maria's story (35% -- social relevance)
- Explain that Clara works on WhatsApp -- no app download, no smartphone upgrade needed (30% -- feasibility)
- Demo the voice interface in Spanish and French, image analysis of documents (25% -- inclusion/accessibility)
- Present scaling math: cost per user, infrastructure on Render, extensible KB (10% -- expected impact)

### What Differentiates Finalists from Winners

Research across multiple hackathon judging guides reveals consistent patterns:

1. **Working demos beat slide-only pitches every time.** Judges associate visual clarity and working code with product maturity. A polished demo with a mediocre slide deck beats a beautiful slide deck with no demo.

2. **User experience matters enormously.** "A hack that works but confuses everyone isn't solving the problem. Clean UI, intuitive flows, and a thoughtful pitch deck can elevate a project from good to great."

3. **The story sells as much as the code.** Judges evaluate "whether the pitch sold the idea as much as the code itself." Teams that tell coherent stories about real people consistently score higher than teams that lead with technical architecture.

4. **Confidence and passion are contagious.** "The more you show (authentically) how excited you are about what you're talking about, the more excited the audience will be."

### The "Wow Factor" -- Memorable Moments

Past hackathon winners consistently create one memorable moment that judges talk about after the event:

- **Bill Gates released mosquitoes** during his TED Talk about malaria to make the audience feel the problem
- **Live interactions with real users** during demos (if a team member or friend sends a real WhatsApp message to Clara during the presentation)
- **Unexpected contrast**: Showing the current experience (3-hour phone hold, complex government website) next to Clara's 30-second voice conversation
- **The "aha" moment**: When the demo processes a photo of a real government document and returns actionable guidance in real-time

**Recommendation for Clara:** During the live demo, have a team member in the audience send a **real voice message in French** to Clara's WhatsApp number. When the audience hears the response come through in real-time, in both languages, that is the "wow" moment. It proves the technology works, demonstrates inclusivity, and creates a visceral, memorable experience for judges.

### Past OdiseIA Winners -- Lessons

GaIA (2025 Wolaria Award winner) focused on helping families and caregivers support seniors through an app plus hardware. Key takeaways from their win:

- They targeted a specific vulnerable group (elderly/seniors) rather than trying to solve everything
- They combined software (app) with tangible hardware, showing they thought beyond code
- They emphasized caregiver support, not just end-user support -- showing systems thinking
- The 2025 edition had 300+ participants and 30 teams from 20 countries, so competition is significant
