## 1. AI Video Generation Tools Comparison (Feb 2026)

The AI video generation landscape has matured dramatically. Resolution has jumped from 720p to native 4K, video length has extended from 3-5 seconds to 20+ seconds, and models now generate synchronized audio natively. Below is a comparison of the major platforms.

### Tool-by-Tool Breakdown

| Tool | Best For | Max Resolution | Max Duration | Native Audio | Pricing (Entry) |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Sora 2** (OpenAI) | Storytelling, emotional depth, dialogue | 4K | 20s | Yes | Free (limited) / $20/mo (Plus) / $200/mo (Pro) |
| **Veo 3.1** (Google) | Cinematic B-roll, prompt adherence, polish | 4K | 8s+ | Yes | Via Vertex AI pricing |
| **Kling 3.0** (Kuaishou) | High-volume social content, speed, consistency | 4K | 3-15s multi-shot | Yes | ~$10/mo starter |
| **Runway Gen 4** | VFX, stylized content, creative experimentation | 4K | 10s+ | Partial | $15/mo (Standard) / $35/mo (Pro) |
| **Pika Labs** | Fast social loops, budget-friendly | 1080p | 3-5s | No | Free tier / $8/mo starter |
| **Luma Dream Machine** | Motion-intense explainers, lip-sync | 1080p (4K upscale) | 5s+ | No | $9.99/mo (Lite) / $29.99/mo (Plus) |

### Detailed Platform Analysis

**Sora 2** is the most creatively intelligent model available. It excels at storytelling, emotional depth, and dialogue-driven scenes. Its distinguishing strengths include emotional range, subtle facial expressions, natural body language, and convincing gesture timing. When prompted with descriptions like "she pauses, looks away, then turns back with visible resolve," Sora produces nuanced performance rather than rigid state transitions. For Clara's social impact storytelling -- showing vulnerable populations navigating bureaucracy, finding hope through assistance -- Sora 2 is the strongest choice.

**Google Veo 3.1** leads in overall preference benchmarks, consistently outperforming Sora 2 and Runway Gen 4 in accurately following complex multi-element prompts. It delivers the best cinematic stability and 4K polish for agency-grade B-roll. If the demo video needs polished establishing shots of Spanish cities or government offices, Veo excels.

**Kling 3.0** introduces multi-shot sequences (3-15 seconds) with subject consistency across different camera angles. It is the most practical professional AI video generator for high-volume social output. Best for creating multiple short clips quickly for social media promotion.

**Runway Gen 4** remains the most flexible playground for experimentation and stylized creativity, with traditional camera controls (pan/tilt/zoom) that other platforms lack. Good for creative visual effects in the demo video.

**Pika Labs** shines for fast social loops on modest budgets, with the Turbo model averaging 12 seconds per three-second clip. Ideal for quick social media assets.

**Luma Dream Machine** excels at motion-intense explainers, with Ray2 model rendering lip-sync-ready mouth shapes that reduce post-production fixes. Its $9.99/mo Lite tier is budget-friendly but limited to non-commercial use.

### Recommendation for Clara's Demo Video

For a hackathon demo video telling Clara's social impact story, the recommended approach is:

1. **Sora 2** for emotional narrative scenes (a woman receiving help via WhatsApp, an elderly person listening to a voice note)
2. **Veo 3.1** for polished cinematic B-roll (Spanish cityscapes, government buildings)
3. **Kling 3.0** for quick social media cuts and promotional clips

### Prompting Techniques for Social Impact Storytelling

The industry has shifted from vague prompts to "Technical Orchestration" with eight control layers: subject, emotion, optics, motion, lighting, style, audio, and continuity.

**Best practices:**

- **Precision over vagueness:** Instead of "a woman using her phone," use "a 30-year-old Spanish woman with warm brown eyes sits at a kitchen table, looking at her phone with a mixture of relief and hope, soft natural window light, shallow depth of field, 85mm prime lens"
- **Emotion Tokens:** Instead of "happy person," use "Subject exhibits a micro-smile, eye glint, and relaxed brows; transition from restrained anxiety to visible relief at 0:04"
- **Camera specificity:** Include terms like "dolly zoom," "tracking pan," or "85mm prime, f/1.4, shallow depth of field"
- **Combine text and visual references:** Text describes action, timing, and motion; reference images define style, composition, and visual specifics
- **Be specific about critical elements** (skin tones, environmental details) while using broader descriptions for atmospheric touches

### Ethical Considerations

- Avoid depicting identifiable real individuals without consent
- Do not perpetuate stereotypes about vulnerable or immigrant populations
- Ensure generated faces do not resemble real people
- Consider using AI video for abstract/atmospheric shots and real footage for testimonials
- Always disclose AI-generated content in credits

## 2. Sonic Branding and Audio Identity for AI Assistants

### How Major Assistants Use Sonic Branding

Voice assistant brands have invested heavily in audio identity:

- **Amazon Alexa:** Amazon invested over $100 million in developing Alexa's speech patterns, intonation, and response sounds. Consumer testing revealed that 73% of users prefer interacting with Alexa over competing assistants primarily due to vocal qualities rather than functionality. The wake word itself ("Alexa") was chosen for its soft consonants and flowing vowels.
- **Apple Siri:** Uses a distinctive ascending two-tone chime that signals attentiveness. The sound is designed to feel responsive without being intrusive.
- **Google Assistant:** Employs a four-note ascending motif that matches its visual brand colors. The tone conveys helpfulness and readiness.

Companies developing voice-first applications report that users demonstrate **45% higher brand affinity** when custom audio signatures accompany voice interactions compared to generic system sounds.

### The Science of Warm vs. Cold Sounds

Frequency plays a critical role in how users perceive a brand's sonic identity:

| Frequency Range | Perception | Application for Clara |
|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Below 250 Hz | Power, luxury, gravitas | Subtle warmth in base tones |
| 250-2000 Hz | Warmth, clarity, human voice range | **Primary range for Clara's audio identity** |
| Above 4000 Hz | Innovation, technology, alertness | Use sparingly for notification cues |

Key principles:
- **Consistent moderate levels (60-70 dB)** build trust associations
- **Sudden volume changes** create excitement but reduce comfort -- avoid for Clara
- **Low-frequency warmth** combined with mid-range clarity conveys safety and approachability
- Human voices in the 250-500 Hz range feel naturally warm and trustworthy

### Audio Feedback Patterns for Elderly Users

Effective audio UX for elderly and vulnerable users requires careful consideration:

- **Confirmation sounds:** Short, warm chimes that indicate successful actions (message sent, form submitted). Should be distinct but not startling. A soft ascending two-note pattern works well.
- **Error sounds:** Gentle, non-alarming tones. Avoid harsh buzzes or sharp beeps. A soft descending two-note pattern signals "try again" without anxiety.
- **Processing/waiting sounds:** A subtle, rhythmic pulse that conveys "I'm working on it" without urgency. Think of a gentle heartbeat rhythm.
- **Volume control is essential:** Always provide users the ability to adjust or mute sounds. Sensory overload is a real concern for elderly users.
- Audio feedback should be concise, unobtrusive, and convey clear messages through short, simple sounds.

### Designing Clara's Audio Logo

Based on sonic branding principles, Clara's audio logo should:

1. **Duration:** 2-3 seconds maximum (Intel's iconic signature is just 3 seconds)
2. **Tonal character:** Warm mid-range frequencies (300-600 Hz base), avoiding harsh high frequencies
3. **Waveform:** A triangle or sine wave foundation (softer than square waves, warmer than sawtooth). Triangle waves produce odd harmonics that sound gentle and organic.
4. **Melodic contour:** A gentle ascending pattern (two or three notes) conveying hope and welcome. Consider an interval of a major third (C to E) which conveys openness and warmth.
5. **Instrumentation feel:** Emulate acoustic instruments -- soft piano, gentle marimba, or warm nylon guitar
6. **Consistency:** The audio logo should be the seed for all other audio cues (notifications, confirmations, errors) -- a "cohesive sonic system" rather than a standalone mnemonic

### Music Theory of Trust

Research identifies specific musical characteristics that convey safety and trust:

| Element | Trust/Safety Choice | Why |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| **Key** | G Major, A Major, Bb Major | G Major expresses "every gentle and peaceful emotion of the heart" and "calm, satisfied passion." A Major conveys "hope" and "trust in God." |
| **Mode** | Major (not minor) | Major keys are associated with positive emotions. Minor keys can convey sadness or tension. |
| **Tempo** | 60-80 BPM | Matches resting heart rate. Feels calm and natural. Avoids rushing. |
| **Instruments** | Acoustic guitar, piano, warm strings, soft woodwinds | Organic timbres signal authenticity. Synthesizers can feel cold or artificial. |
| **Dynamics** | Soft to moderate (pp to mf) | Quiet sounds feel intimate and safe. Loud sounds feel alarming. |
| **Rhythm** | Steady, predictable | Syncopation or irregular rhythms create tension. Steady rhythms feel stable. |

Research confirms that group singing and shared musical experiences increase scores on measures of trust, and participation in joint musical activity fosters trust and cooperation.

## 3. TTS Voice Design for Social Impact

### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Voices | Languages | Latency | Quality Rating | Custom Voice | Pricing |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **ElevenLabs** | 5,000+ library + custom | 29 languages | 75ms (Flash v2.5) | Best-in-class (top score 37% of cases) | Yes (voice cloning) | Free tier / $5/mo (Starter) |
| **Google Cloud TTS (WaveNet/Neural2)** | 300+ | 50+ languages | Moderate | Very good | Yes (custom) | $16/million chars (WaveNet) |
| **Azure Neural TTS** | 400+ | 140+ languages | Low | Very good | Yes (Custom Neural Voice) | Pay-per-use |
| **Gemini TTS** | Native via Gemini models | 24+ languages | Integrated | Good (improving rapidly) | Limited | Via Gemini API |
| **Amazon Polly** | 60+ | 30+ languages | Low | Good | Limited | $4/million chars (Standard) |
| **Qwen-TTS** | Limited | Chinese-focused, expanding | Variable | Improving | Limited | Open-source options |

### Detailed Analysis for Clara

**ElevenLabs** stands as the quality leader. Its Eleven v3 model delivers "emotionally nuanced speech that frequently makes listeners question whether they're hearing human or synthetic output." The platform's voice cloning capability could allow creating a custom "Clara voice" from a small sample of a Spanish voice actress. The partnership with Stroke Onward demonstrates its commitment to social impact -- using voice cloning to restore stroke survivors' voices for communication apps.

**Google Cloud TTS** offers the broadest language coverage (50+ languages) and handles code-switching between languages well -- critical for Clara's Spanish+French requirements. WaveNet voices cost $16 per million characters, making it affordable at scale.

**Azure Neural TTS** supports 140+ languages with 400+ voices, including bilingual and regional variants. The Custom Neural Voice feature allows organizations to train bespoke AI voice models using their own audio recordings. Best for enterprise-scale deployments.

**Gemini TTS** is integrated into the Gemini model Clara already uses, supporting 24+ languages with on-the-fly language switches and subtle effects like whispering. The integration advantage is significant -- no additional API calls or services needed.

### Voice Characteristics That Build Trust with Elderly Users

Research from emotion-aware voice assistant studies reveals critical design principles:

- **Pitch adjustments** creating warmth and understanding (lower pitch ranges feel more trustworthy)
- **Speaking pace** showing patience and attention (slower than typical conversational speed)
- **Volume control** demonstrating appropriate energy levels (consistent, moderate)
- **Calmness through neutrality:** A flat, calm tone assures users the assistant is not biased, creating a sense of objectivity
- **Companionship is the most critical factor** affecting older adults' intention to adopt voice assistant use, demonstrating the pivotal role of emotional connection
- **Dual style fluidity:** Designers should support both a simple/formal style for regular information delivery and a more empathetic/anthropomorphic style for personal or sensitive matters

For Clara specifically, the voice should be:
- **Warm but not saccharine** -- genuine empathy without condescension
- **Steady pacing** -- approximately 130-150 words per minute (vs. typical 160-180 WPM)
- **Clear articulation** -- especially important for elderly users and non-native speakers
- **Consistent pitch** -- avoiding dramatic intonation changes that might feel artificial
- **Natural pausing** -- allowing processing time after important information

### Multilingual TTS Challenges (Spanish + French + Arabic)

- **Code-switching:** When Clara needs to include French terms in a Spanish response (or vice versa), the TTS must handle language boundaries gracefully. Google Cloud TTS and Speechmatics handle this best.
- **Regional accents:** Spanish from Spain vs. Latin America has significant pronunciation differences. Clara should use Castilian Spanish (peninsular) to match her persona.
- **Arabic future expansion:** Arabic presents particular challenges with right-to-left text processing, diacritical marks affecting pronunciation, and significant dialect variation (Modern Standard Arabic vs. regional dialects). Azure and Google offer the broadest Arabic dialect support.
- **Prosody preservation:** Emotional tone must carry across languages -- a reassuring statement in Spanish should feel equally reassuring in French translation.

### Ethics of AI Voice Design for Vulnerable Populations

- **EU mandates (2026):** Lawmakers are requiring AI voice disclosure -- users must know they are interacting with AI, not a human
- **Consent protocols:** ElevenLabs has implemented watermarking and consent frameworks for voice cloning
- **Avoiding manipulation:** AI voices that sound "too human" with vulnerable populations raise ethical concerns about trust exploitation
- **UNHCR precedent:** UNHCR operates 20 WhatsApp lines in 12 languages for displaced populations, using Turn.io's platform. Their chatbot implementations demonstrate ethical guardrails: clear AI disclosure, data protection, and appropriate handoff to human agents for sensitive situations
- **Transparency principle:** Clara should always identify herself as an AI assistant, never impersonating a human caseworker

## 4. Music for Social Impact Videos (AI-Generated)

### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Best For | Max Duration | Audio Quality | Commercial Rights | Pricing |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **Suno** | Complete songs with vocals, social content | 4 min | Good | Paid plans only (2026 policy change) | Free (non-commercial) / ~$10/mo |
| **Udio** | Instrumental production, lyrical realism | 2-4 min | Near-studio quality | Paid plans | ~$10/mo |
| **Stable Audio 2.5** | Instrumentals, ambient, background scores | 3 min | 44.1kHz stereo | Licensed dataset (AudioSparx) | Via Stability AI |
| **Beatoven.ai** | Marketing-focused background music | Variable | Good | Yes | Subscription |

### Detailed Analysis

**Suno** excels at short-form social content requiring catchy hooks and memorable audio, with under-60-second generation speed enabling rapid iteration. It leads in overall quality for complete songs with vocals. However, its 2026 policy changes are important: music created on free accounts **cannot be used commercially**, and training data must now be licensed following the Warner Music Group settlement.

**Udio** is rated "almost indistinguishable from real recordings" with superior sound fidelity. It leads in clean instrumental production for webinars and product demos. For Clara's demo video, Udio would produce the highest-quality background instrumental.

**Stable Audio 2.5** was exclusively trained on a licensed dataset from AudioSparx, honoring opt-out requests and ensuring fair compensation for creators. This makes it the most ethically defensible choice for organizations concerned about copyright. It can generate ambient music, atmospheric textures, and full instrumental tracks up to three minutes at 44.1kHz stereo.

### Best Prompts for "Hopeful Civic Tech" Music

Based on Suno prompting best practices, effective prompts combine four elements: genre/style, mood/emotion, instrumentation, and vocal preferences.

**Example prompts for Clara's demo video:**

1. *Background track:* "Uplifting acoustic folk instrumental, warm fingerstyle nylon guitar, gentle marimba, soft brushed percussion, hopeful and empathetic, 72 BPM, G major, cinematic warmth, Spanish Mediterranean influence"

2. *Emotional montage:* "Inspiring ambient instrumental, warm piano arpeggios, subtle strings, gentle crescendo, conveying hope and resilience, 68 BPM, A major, humanitarian documentary style"

3. *Opening/closing:* "Gentle acoustic intro, solo nylon guitar, warm and intimate, Mediterranean feel, building slowly with soft cello, 60 BPM, hopeful, community empowerment"

4. *Social media clip:* "Modern uplifting electronic-acoustic hybrid, warm synth pads, acoustic guitar accents, optimistic and forward-looking, civic tech innovation feel, 80 BPM"

**Tips for generation:**
- Generate 6+ takes per prompt and iterate
- Use evocative emotional words: "uplifting," "serene," "resilient," "hopeful"
- Specify instruments clearly: "fingerstyle nylon guitar" rather than just "guitar"
- Include tempo (BPM) and key for consistency
- Mention reference styles: "humanitarian documentary," "social impact film"

### Music Psychology for Hope and Empowerment

Research confirms specific musical elements that convey hope:

- **Tempo:** 60-80 BPM for calm/trust, 80-100 BPM for gentle optimism and forward motion
- **Key:** G Major ("gentle and peaceful emotion"), A Major ("hope, trust"), Bb Major ("cheerful love, hope for a better world")
- **Instruments:** Acoustic and organic timbres (guitar, piano, strings, woodwinds) signal authenticity and human connection
- **Dynamics:** Start soft, build gradually -- the "crescendo of hope" pattern is universal in social impact filmmaking
- **Rhythm:** Steady and predictable patterns create psychological safety; syncopation can add gentle energy without anxiety

Research from music therapy shows that music-based interventions significantly increase hope and decrease anxiety, with changes in hope being a significant mediator in reduced anxiety symptoms.

### Licensing Considerations for Hackathon Demos

**Critical 2026 updates:**
- **Suno free tier:** Cannot be used commercially. Paid subscribers retain usage rights, but the landscape is shifting with the Warner Music Group licensing deal.
- **Udio:** Has licensing deals with both Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. Commercial use requires a paid subscription.
- **Stable Audio:** Trained on licensed AudioSparx data, offering the cleanest IP chain for commercial use.
- **For hackathon demos specifically:** Most platforms' free tiers allow non-commercial use, which covers hackathon presentations. However, if the demo video will be published publicly (YouTube, social media), a paid subscription is recommended for legal safety.
- **Attribution:** Even with paid subscriptions, check each platform's terms for attribution requirements.

## 5. Voiceover Direction for Multilingual Social Impact

### Directing Voiceover for Empathy Without Condescension

The challenge with social impact voiceover is walking the line between warmth and patronization. Key principles:

- **Speak with, not at:** The voice should feel like a knowledgeable friend, not an authority figure lecturing. Clara's persona -- a 30-year-old Spanish woman -- naturally avoids the "institutional voice" trap.
- **Respect intelligence:** Even when explaining complex bureaucratic processes, avoid over-simplification in tone. Keep the language simple but the delivery respectful.
- **Avoid "charity voice":** The breathy, overly emotional tone common in NGO videos can feel manipulative. Clara should sound grounded and practical, with genuine warmth.
- **Match the audience's reality:** As research notes, when a voice is warm, professional, and fits the brand's personality, it builds trust. The tone should reflect the lived experience of the audience.
- **Cultural calibration:** A video using an excitable voiceover in the US may need a more reserved tone for other markets. For Spain, a calm, measured delivery with natural warmth is appropriate.

### Pacing and Pausing for Comprehension

For elderly audiences and non-native speakers:

- **Target 130-150 WPM** (standard narration is 160-180 WPM). Slower pacing allows processing time.
- **Strategic pauses:** 1-2 second pauses after key information (phone numbers, website addresses, steps in a process) give listeners time to absorb.
- **Chunking:** Break complex information into 10-15 second segments with natural pauses between them.
- **Repetition without condescension:** Restate key information using different words, not by repeating the same sentence.
- **Prosodic emphasis:** Use gentle stress on key words (dates, amounts, locations) rather than raising volume.

### Handling Code-Switching (Spanish + French)

When Clara's voiceover needs to move between languages:

- **Script preparation:** Have translations prepared by skilled linguists -- never ask a voice actor to improvise translations. Translations should be adapted, not verbatim, preserving cultural nuances.
- **Voice consistency:** Ideally use the same voice talent for both languages, or voices with matching warmth and pacing characteristics.
- **Transition signals:** Use a brief pause or subtle audio cue when switching languages within a single message.
- **Cultural adaptation:** The tone may need adjustment between languages -- French administrative language has different formality expectations than Spanish.
- **Quality assurance:** Review localized voiceover for clarity, accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and perfect sync with visuals.

### Subtitle and Caption Accessibility

For video content featuring Clara:

- **Font and size:** Use sans-serif fonts at minimum 28px. High contrast (white text on dark semi-transparent background).
- **Duration:** Each subtitle should remain on screen for at least 2 seconds, even for short phrases.
- **Positioning:** Bottom-center for standard dialogue; move to top when important visual content appears at the bottom.
- **Bilingual subtitles:** When audio is in Spanish, offer French subtitles (and vice versa). Consider showing both simultaneously with the secondary language in a smaller font.
- **Audio descriptions:** For visually impaired users, provide descriptions of non-verbal content (on-screen text, visual cues).
- **Caption rate:** Maximum 15 characters per second for comfortable reading, reduced to 12 CPS for content aimed at elderly audiences.

## 6. Podcast and Audio Content Strategy for Civic Tech

### How Audio-First Organizations Reach Low-Literacy Audiences

Audio-first communication is critical for reaching vulnerable populations who may have limited literacy:

- **WhatsApp voice notes** are the dominant communication channel for low-literacy populations. Clara already uses this channel.
- **Interactive Voice Response (IVR)** systems, like UNHCR's call centre in Jordan, triage calls and provide information without requiring literacy.
- **Community radio** remains a powerful channel in many developing contexts. Consider how Clara's content could be adapted for radio-style delivery.
- **Audio content at scale:** AI-powered tools now enable creating audio content at scale, consistently and cost-effectively -- critical for organizations with limited resources.

### WhatsApp Voice Note UX Patterns and Duration

WhatsApp allows voice notes up to **30 minutes** in duration, but best practices for Clara suggest much shorter messages:

| Content Type | Recommended Duration | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Simple answer** (e.g., office hours) | 15-30 seconds | Quick, scannable information |
| **Process explanation** (e.g., how to apply for IMV) | 45-90 seconds | Chunked steps with pauses |
| **Complex guidance** (e.g., document requirements) | 90-120 seconds max | Break into multiple messages if longer |

Key UX findings:
- Users almost unanimously agree that **listening to voice notes is more laborious than reading text**, requiring more concentration
- For Clara, this means voice notes should be **concise, structured, and clearly paced**
- Elderly learners found voice notes useful for **personal reminders** (what to report to a doctor, what to buy)
- Consider sending a brief text summary alongside longer voice notes for reference
- The 1-2 minute sweet spot balances comprehensiveness with attention span

### The Future of Conversational AI Audio Experiences

The 2026 landscape reveals several trends directly relevant to Clara:

**Market scale:** The global voice assistant market is projected to reach $33.74 billion by 2030 (up from $7.35 billion in 2024). The number of US voice assistant users is expected to reach 157.1 million by 2026.

**Key trends:**
1. **Personality-driven voices:** Users are tired of generic, robotic-sounding assistants. When AI voices sound robotic, users disengage; when they sound human, conversion rates improve and trust increases. Clara's warm persona is aligned with this trend.
2. **Multimodal integration:** The future is not just voice -- it is multimodal. Clara could evolve to integrate voice with visual interfaces (the clara-web frontend).
3. **Proactive assistance:** Voice agents can predict common issues based on past interactions and send updates before users check in. Clara could proactively notify users about deadline changes or new aid programs.
4. **On-device processing:** By 2026, high-fidelity perception and rapid decision-making run on device processors, with the cloud reserved for long-horizon reasoning. This could reduce latency for Clara's audio responses.
5. **Advanced source separation:** Devices can isolate individual voices in real-time, even in noisy environments. This improves Whisper transcription quality for users sending voice notes from busy locations.

### Audio Content Strategy Recommendations for Clara

1. **Voice note templates:** Pre-generate audio responses for the most common 20-30 queries using high-quality TTS, ensuring consistent quality and instant delivery.
2. **Audio-first information architecture:** Structure knowledge base content around how it will sound, not just how it reads. Test all content as audio before deployment.
3. **Bilingual audio strategy:** For users who speak both Spanish and French, consider offering a "language preference" setting rather than detecting language each time.
4. **Community amplification:** Enable users to share Clara's voice note responses with family and community members -- voice notes are inherently shareable on WhatsApp.
5. **Feedback loops:** Use voice notes from users as direct feedback. The emotional content of voice (tone, pacing, stress) contains information that text messages cannot convey.

## Summary: Actionable Recommendations for Clara

### Immediate (Hackathon Demo)

1. **Demo video:** Use Sora 2 for emotional narrative scenes + Veo 3.1 for polished B-roll. Budget: ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) covers Sora access.
2. **Background music:** Generate with Udio or Stable Audio 2.5. Prompt: "Uplifting acoustic folk instrumental, warm nylon guitar, gentle marimba, hopeful, 72 BPM, G major, Mediterranean warmth." Generate 6+ takes.
3. **Audio logo:** Create a 2-3 second warm ascending motif in G Major, using triangle/sine wave foundation at 300-600 Hz, evoking soft piano or marimba.
4. **TTS for demo:** Continue with Gemini TTS (already integrated) for the demo. Consider ElevenLabs for the polished demo video narration.

### Short-Term (Post-Hackathon)

5. **Custom Clara voice:** Invest in an ElevenLabs custom voice clone based on a Spanish voice actress recording, ensuring consistent voice identity across all interactions.
6. **Sonic system:** Develop a complete audio feedback system: confirmation chime, processing pulse, error tone, greeting motif -- all derived from Clara's audio logo.
7. **Voice note optimization:** Pre-generate the top 20-30 most common responses as high-quality audio files using the custom Clara voice.

### Long-Term

8. **Multilingual voice consistency:** Maintain Clara's vocal characteristics across Spanish, French, and future Arabic using ElevenLabs multilingual voice cloning.
9. **Proactive audio:** Implement push voice notifications for deadline reminders and new aid program announcements.
10. **Ethical framework:** Establish clear AI disclosure in all voice interactions, consent protocols for any voice data, and regular audits of voice design for potential bias or manipulation.
