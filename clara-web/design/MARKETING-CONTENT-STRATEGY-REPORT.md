## 1. Social Impact Campaigns That Went Viral (2024-2026)

### What Makes Social Impact Content Shareable

The campaigns that broke through in 2025 share three defining traits: **authenticity over polish**, **participation over consumption**, and **purpose-driven messaging** that connects values to action.

**Authenticity trumps perfection.** Brands like Duolingo succeeded with an "unhinged" social presence, while Canva used self-deprecating billboards. The underlying principle is the same for social impact: audiences engage more with genuine, imperfect stories than with slick marketing. For Clara, this means showing real WhatsApp conversation screenshots, raw audio transcripts, and behind-the-scenes hackathon moments rather than polished renders.

**Participation, not consumption.** The most successful 2025 campaigns invited users to *do something*: take a challenge, share their story, co-create content. The "EcoRevolution Challenge" used AR filters to engage environmental advocacy; the "Faces of Change" campaign used authentic influencer stories to spotlight social justice issues. For Clara, the equivalent is inviting users and advocates to share their own stories of navigating bureaucracy -- "What was your hardest government process?" as a prompt.

**Purpose-driven framing.** Always' "#LikeAGirl" model -- building emotional resonance around a mission rather than a product -- remains the gold standard. The campaign shifted conversation from product features to brand values. Clara's equivalent: the campaign is not about the technology (Whisper, Gemini, RAG), it is about Maria finally understanding what documents she needs to apply for the IMV.

### The Empowerment vs. Victimhood Debate

The nonprofit sector has undergone a significant shift away from "poverty porn" -- exploitative imagery of suffering -- toward **stories of resilience, agency, and partnership**.

Key developments:
- **Comic Relief** announced it would stop sending celebrities to African countries for fundraising, signaling the death of "poverty tourism" content.
- The mandate for 2025 involves "redefining international aid through strategically investing in localization and equity by moving resources and decision-making authority into the hands of community leaders."
- Social impact campaigns are now expected to address complex issues "in engaging and constructive ways instead of blaming or fear-mongering."

**Actionable for Clara:** Frame users as resourceful people navigating a complex system, not helpless victims. Maria is not a passive recipient -- she is someone who *actively seeks* help and Clara *empowers* her to succeed. The language should be: "Clara helps Maria navigate..." not "Clara saves Maria from..."

### Platform-Specific Shareability

| Platform | What Works | Format |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **LinkedIn** | Carousels with data + personal narrative; visual storytelling generates up to 596% higher engagement than text-only | Carousel (swipeable mini-presentations), long-form personal posts |
| **Instagram** | Shares and saves are now prioritized over likes; 94% of nonprofit influencer campaigns use Instagram; Reels dominate | Reels (60% of content), Carousels (30%), Single images (10%); 4:5 ratio (1080x1350px) |
| **Twitter/X** | Threads with data storytelling; hashtag activism drives civic engagement | Threads with statistics + emotional hook; quote-tweet chains |
| **TikTok** | Short-form under 90 seconds; participatory challenges | Behind-the-scenes; "Day in the life" format; duet challenges |

## 2. Content Strategy for Hackathon Demos and Judges

### What Hackathon Judges Look For

Standard hackathon judging frameworks weight these categories:

| Criterion | Typical Weight | What Judges Assess |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Innovation / Creativity** | 20-30% | Originality of the idea; novel approach to the problem |
| **Technical Execution** | 30-40% | Code quality, functionality, scalability, working prototype |
| **Impact / Practicality** | 10-30% | Does it solve something real? Does the team understand the problem? |
| **Design / UX** | 15-20% | Clean UI, intuitive flows; "a hack that works but confuses everyone isn't really solving the problem" |
| **Presentation Quality** | 10-15% | Storytelling, clarity, confidence, time management |

For OdiseIA4Good specifically, the jury evaluates "the most innovative projects with the greatest social impact," and teams defend their projects through **elevator pitches**. Winners receive mentoring, technical support, incubation, and international visibility.

### The 60-Second User Story

The most effective hackathon pitches follow this structure:

1. **Hook (0-10 seconds):** Open with a surprising fact, bold statement, or relatable scenario. For Clara: "In Spain, 2 million people receive the Ingreso Minimo Vital. But many more who qualify never apply -- because they cannot understand the paperwork."
2. **Problem (10-25 seconds):** Paint a vivid picture with real-world data. "Maria, 68, moved from Morocco. She speaks French, not Spanish. She has no computer. She has a phone with WhatsApp."
3. **Solution (25-45 seconds):** Demo the working product. Show the WhatsApp conversation. Play the audio response. "Maria sends a voice message in French. Clara transcribes it, understands her question, and responds with step-by-step guidance -- in her language."
4. **Impact (45-60 seconds):** Close with the scale of the opportunity. "4.5 million vulnerable people in Spain could benefit. Clara is free, requires no app download, and works on any phone."

**Critical rules:**
- If judges do not know within 30 seconds why they should care, you have lost them.
- A working prototype is always better than slides.
- Avoid jargon -- judges will not decode "RAG pipeline with pgvector hybrid BM25+vector search."
- Many people watch demos without sound; ensure the story is understandable visually.

### Best Demo Video Formats

| Format | Length | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Elevator pitch video** | 30-60 seconds | Social media, judge pre-screening |
| **Explainer video** | 60-90 seconds | Website landing page, post-hackathon outreach |
| **Full demo walkthrough** | 2-3 minutes | Technical evaluation, YouTube |
| **Behind-the-scenes reel** | 15-30 seconds | Instagram Reels, TikTok, hackathon atmosphere |

Campaigns with video pitches raise on average **114% more** funds than those without video (Indiegogo data). The first few seconds are critical -- audiences decide almost immediately whether to keep watching.

## 3. Social Media Strategy for Civic Tech / Tech for Good

### Platform Selection for Clara

| Platform | Audience | Clara Fit | Priority |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **LinkedIn** | Professionals, judges, investors, NGO leaders, hackathon community | Thought leadership, OdiseIA network, post-hackathon partnerships | HIGH |
| **Instagram** | General public, younger advocates, design community | Visual storytelling, Reels, behind-the-scenes | HIGH |
| **Twitter/X** | Tech community, journalists, civic tech advocates | Real-time hackathon updates, thread storytelling | MEDIUM |
| **TikTok** | Younger audiences, viral potential | Short emotional clips, "AI for good" angle | MEDIUM-LOW |

Instagram is the most commonly used platform for nonprofit influencer campaigns (94% of nonprofits that engage in influencer campaigns work with influencers on Instagram). For Spain specifically, engagement is about **conversation, not just content distribution** -- replying to comments and creating two-way interactions is critical to building loyalty.

### Hashtag Strategy for Spain

**Primary hashtags (high volume, broad reach):**
- #TechForGood
- #AIForGood
- #SocialImpact
- #ImpactoSocial
- #InnovacionSocial

**Event-specific hashtags:**
- #OdiseIA4Good
- #OdiseIA4Good2026
- #OdiseIA
- #HackathonMadrid
- #UDIT

**Clara-specific hashtags:**
- #ClaraAI
- #ClaraAsistente
- #IAParaTodos
- #AccesibilidadDigital

**Cause-specific hashtags:**
- #IngresoMinimoVital
- #AyudasSociales
- #InclusionDigital
- #Migracion
- #PersonasMayores

**Best practice:** Use 3-5 highly relevant hashtags per post rather than 30 generic ones. On Instagram, keywords in captions now help content get recommended by the algorithm. On LinkedIn, 3 hashtags is the sweet spot.

### 1-Week Hackathon Launch Content Calendar

| Day | Platform(s) | Content | Content Pillar |
|-----|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Mon (Day -2)** | LinkedIn, Instagram | "We are heading to OdiseIA4Good" -- team photo, mission statement, the problem we are solving | Educational (40%) |
| **Tue (Day -1)** | Instagram Stories, X | Behind-the-scenes: packing, prepping, whiteboard sketches of Clara's architecture | Behind-the-Scenes (20%) |
| **Wed (Day 1)** | All platforms | Hackathon kickoff! Live stories, first prototype screenshots, team working photos | Behind-the-Scenes |
| **Thu (Day 2)** | Instagram Reel, LinkedIn | 30-second demo video: Maria sends a voice note, Clara responds. Caption with impact data | Social Proof (20%) |
| **Fri (Day 3)** | All platforms | Pitch day! Before/after energy. Results announcement. Team celebration or reflection | Community & Engagement (10%) |
| **Sat (Post-event)** | LinkedIn (long post), Instagram Carousel | Full recap: what we built, what we learned, what is next for Clara. Tag judges, mentors, OdiseIA | Educational |
| **Sun (Post-event)** | X Thread, Instagram | "The Maria Story" -- a narrative thread telling one user's journey through Clara. Call to action for partnerships | Educational |

**Content pillar framework:** Educational (40%), Behind-the-Scenes (20%), Social Proof (20%), Product Updates (10%), Community & Engagement (10%). Early-stage projects should prioritize educational content to build authority and behind-the-scenes content to build connection.

### Accessibility Best Practices for Social Media Images

**Alt text guidelines:**
- Keep alt text under 100 characters; screen readers announce "image" automatically, so do not include the word "image"
- Follow the formula: **Who, What, Where, When** -- starting with the most important elements
- 81% of visually impaired adults use social media, yet they are often excluded from visual content
- Example for Clara: "Screenshot of WhatsApp conversation where Clara responds to a voice message in French with step-by-step IMV application guidance in Spanish"

**Image formatting:**
- Use Instagram's recommended 4:5 ratio (1080x1350 px) for feed posts
- Ensure text on images meets WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Provide captions on all video content

## 4. Video Marketing for Social Impact Tech

### AI Video Generation Tools Comparison

| Tool | Best For | Resolution | Audio | Price | Clara Use Case |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Sora 2** (OpenAI) | Photorealism, narrative coherence | Up to 4K | Native audio sync | ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) | Hero video: cinematic storytelling of Maria's journey |
| **Runway Gen-4** | Creative control, VFX, stylized content | Up to 4K | Post-generation | From $15/mo | Stylized explainer animations of Clara's architecture |
| **Google Veo 3** | Cinematic stability, 4K polish | 4K native | Native generation | Per-second billing | B-roll footage for presentation video |
| **Kling AI** | Speed, volume, lip-sync | 1080p | Lip-sync support | From $12/mo | Quick social media clips, UGC-style content |

**Recommendation for Clara:** Use **Sora 2** for the primary demo/pitch video (highest realism for the "Maria story"), **Kling** for rapid social media content production during the hackathon, and **Runway** for any stylized infographic animations.

### Music for Social Impact Videos

**Suno AI** is the leading AI music generation platform for creating original, royalty-free emotional tracks:
- v4.5 (May 2025) supports "emotionally expressive music using just text prompts"
- Describe the mood: "warm, hopeful, gentle piano, Spanish acoustic guitar, building to uplifting orchestral"
- Pro/Premier subscribers own full commercial rights
- Can generate music that matches the emotional arc of a video (calm introduction, building tension, hopeful resolution)

**Prompt suggestion for Clara's video music:** "Warm acoustic guitar, gentle piano, hopeful and empowering mood, building slowly, Spanish influence, suitable for a social impact documentary about helping immigrants navigate government services"

### Voiceover Best Practices for Multilingual Audiences

**ElevenLabs** is the recommended tool for multilingual voiceover:
- **Multilingual v2:** 29 languages with rich emotional expression and natural prosody
- **Turbo 2.5:** 32 languages, 3x faster generation for non-English
- **Eleven v3:** 70+ languages, most natural output (research preview)
- **AI Dubbing:** Preserves the voice of the original speaker across 20+ languages

**Best practices:**
- Write out numbers as words (not digits) -- especially critical for multilingual models
- Use proper punctuation to guide rhythm; ellipses add pauses, capitalization signals emphasis
- Neutral voices tend to be more stable across languages
- For Clara: record voiceover in Spanish first, then use AI dubbing to create French and Arabic versions while preserving voice characteristics

### Subtitle and Caption Best Practices

**WCAG compliance requirements:**
- Level A: Captions required for all prerecorded audio content
- Level AA: Captions required for all live audio content
- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 (Level AA), 7:1 (Level AAA)
- Font size: at least 14pt; avoid thin or unusual fonts
- No caption segment shorter than 1.33 seconds or longer than 6 seconds
- Captions must not block important visual information

**Closed vs. open captions:** Closed captions are preferred for web content (user-customizable), but for social media where platform support varies, **burned-in (open) captions** ensure universal visibility. Use high-contrast white text with a semi-transparent dark background.

**For Clara's multilingual context:** Provide dual subtitles when showing the French-to-Spanish interaction -- French on top, Spanish translation below -- to visually demonstrate the real-time translation capability.

## 5. Press Release and Storytelling Frameworks

### The StoryBrand Framework Applied to Clara

The StoryBrand Framework (Donald Miller) provides a 7-element structure rooted in the Hero's Journey. The core principle: **your customer is the hero, you (your product) are the guide.**

Applied to Clara:

| StoryBrand Element | Clara Application |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **1. A Character** (the hero) | Maria, 68, Moroccan immigrant in Madrid. Speaks French. Has a basic phone with WhatsApp. |
| **2. Has a Problem** | **External:** She needs to apply for the Ingreso Minimo Vital but cannot understand the paperwork. **Internal:** She feels overwhelmed, ashamed of not understanding, afraid of making mistakes. **Philosophical:** It is wrong that language and technology barriers prevent people from accessing aid they are legally entitled to. |
| **3. Meets a Guide** | Clara -- a free WhatsApp assistant that speaks her language and understands government processes. |
| **4. Who Gives Them a Plan** | Clara provides a clear, step-by-step process: (1) Send a voice message describing your situation, (2) Receive personalized guidance in your language, (3) Follow the steps to complete your application. |
| **5. And Calls Them to Action** | "Enviame un mensaje de voz y te ayudo" / "Send me a voice message and I will help you." |
| **6. That Helps Them Avoid Failure** | Without Clara: missed deadlines, rejected applications, lost aid worth EUR 500+/month, continued poverty and social exclusion. |
| **7. And Ends in Success** | Maria successfully applies for the IMV. She receives EUR 604/month. She tells her neighbor. Her neighbor tells her church group. The cycle of access expands. |

### The "Maria Story" Narrative Technique

This technique personalizes impact through one person's journey. It is rooted in research showing that **63% of people remember stories but only 5% remember statistics** (Stanford, Chip Heath).

**The Maria Story -- Full Narrative Arc:**

> Maria arrived in Madrid from Casablanca three years ago. She is 68, lives alone, and speaks French -- not Spanish. She heard about the Ingreso Minimo Vital from a neighbor but when she tried to apply, the forms were in Spanish, the website required a digital certificate she did not have, and the phone helpline had a 45-minute wait in a language she could not follow.
>
> Then her grandson showed her how to send a WhatsApp message. She sent a voice note in French: "I need help with the income assistance. I do not know what papers I need."
>
> Clara responded in 8 seconds -- in French -- with a clear list: her passport, her empadronamiento certificate, her bank statement, and where to go to get each one. When Maria asked a follow-up question by sending a photo of a letter she received, Clara read the image and explained what it meant.
>
> Two weeks later, Maria's application was submitted. One month later, she received her first payment of EUR 604.
>
> Maria is one of 4.5 million vulnerable people in Spain who could benefit from Clara.

### Data Storytelling: Emotion + Statistics

The most effective social impact communications combine emotional narrative with hard data. The framework:

1. **Lead with the person** (Maria's story)
2. **Zoom out to the scale** (4.5 million vulnerable people; 2 million IMV recipients; 674,000 households)
3. **Show the gap** (many eligible people never apply due to language/digital barriers)
4. **Present the solution with measurable impact** (Clara responds in 8 seconds, supports 3 languages, requires no app download)
5. **Close with the person again** (Maria's life changed)

Key statistics for Clara's storytelling:
- **2,050,000 people** receive the IMV in Spain across 674,000 households
- The IMV excludes most people aged 18-22 and those without one year of continuous legal residence
- Low take-up among Roma populations and immigrant communities due to digital/language barriers
- Over 2,000 people died from extreme temperatures in 2024, with 95%+ aged 65+, illustrating the vulnerability of elderly populations
- The government launched a plan to "improve advice to people eligible for the IMV" -- Clara is the technological implementation of this goal

## 7. Actionable Recommendations for Clara

### Immediate (Hackathon Week: Feb 23-25)

1. **Prepare a 60-second pitch video** following the Hook-Problem-Solution-Impact structure. Record before the hackathon starts so it is ready for social sharing on Day 1.

2. **Create "The Maria Story"** as a LinkedIn carousel (8-10 slides) and an Instagram Reel (30 seconds). Lead with the person, zoom to the data, return to the person.

3. **Live-post behind-the-scenes content** during the hackathon: whiteboard sketches, team working photos, prototype screenshots. Use Instagram Stories and X for real-time content.

4. **Tag strategically:** @OdiseIA, @UDIT, @Google.org in every post. Use #OdiseIA4Good2026 #TechForGood #ImpactoSocial #IAParaTodos consistently.

5. **Prepare alt text** for every image posted. Follow the Who-What-Where-When formula under 100 characters.

### Short-Term (1-2 Weeks Post-Hackathon)

6. **Publish a LinkedIn long-form post** with the full recap: problem, solution, demo, results, what is next. Carousels generate the highest engagement on LinkedIn. Tag all team members, judges, and mentors.

7. **Generate a 90-second explainer video** using Sora 2 for the narrative arc + Suno AI for emotional background music + ElevenLabs for Spanish/French voiceover + burned-in dual subtitles.

8. **Apply to OdiseIA4Good Connect** for post-hackathon mentoring and incubation.

9. **Pitch to Maldita Tecnologia** with the angle: "An AI tool that helps people understand government aid -- fighting misinformation with accessibility."

10. **Contact Ship2B Foundation and Impact Hub Madrid** about their social impact accelerator programs.

### Medium-Term (1-3 Months Post-Hackathon)

11. **Develop a StoryBrand one-liner** for all communications: "Most vulnerable people in Spain never access the aid they are entitled to because of language and digital barriers. Clara is a free WhatsApp assistant that guides them through the process in their language -- so no one misses out on the help they deserve."

12. **Create a press release** using the StoryBrand framework with the three-layer problem (external: complex paperwork; internal: shame and fear; philosophical: access to aid is a right).

13. **Build relationships** with Fundacion Telefonica, COTEC, and Cruz Roja for potential partnerships, distribution, and funding.

14. **Launch a weekly content series** on Instagram: "Tramite de la Semana" (Bureaucratic Process of the Week) -- educational carousels explaining one government process, driving awareness and building authority.

15. **Collect and publish impact data** obsessively: response times, languages served, processes explained, user satisfaction. This becomes the statistical backbone for all future storytelling.

### Core Messaging Principles

- **Clara is the guide, not the hero.** The user is always the hero of the story.
- **Empowerment over victimhood.** Users are resourceful people navigating a complex system, not helpless recipients.
- **Show the WhatsApp conversation.** The most powerful visual asset is a screenshot of a real (or realistic) interaction.
- **Lead with emotion, support with data.** Maria's story first, 4.5 million people second.
- **Accessibility is not optional.** Alt text, captions, multilingual content, and high-contrast design in every piece of content.
